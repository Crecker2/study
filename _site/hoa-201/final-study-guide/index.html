      <li>To the left, three graces
        <ul>
          <li>Three graces are always depicted together with little or no clothing, and one always has her back to us, sensual, golden balls (story), they are friends of Venus/Aphrodite, slouched, touching each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Zephyr is to the right abducting Chloris, and the woman next to Choloris is Flora, after the marriage has taken place (continuous narrative)</li>

  <li>Venus’/Aphrodite’s attribute of the sea is barely visible in the background.
    <ul>
      <li>Mars’/Ares’ attributes of his armor are visible scattered around him.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This painting can be read as the message that “love conquers war” or, more broadly as “love conquers all” (although for my money, that’s reading it a little too broadly).</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Done by a German painter who came to England and served as the court painter for Henry VIII</li>
  <li>They were ambassadors sent to England to reason with Henry to not leave the Catholic church</li>
  <li>French Ambassador on the left (Jean de Dinteville)
    <ul>
      <li>Name and age are inscribed on the dagger on his waist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vatican Ambassador on the right (Georges de Selve)
    <ul>
      <li>Name and age are inscribed on the book</li>

<ul>
  <li>Look at the left hand corner of the painting, where there are the mountains.
    <ul>
      <li>The mountains are all actually the same size, but there is a type of forced perspective by “painting the air” as Da Vinci stated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Aerial perspective</strong> is painting things that are further back blue</li>
  <li>The people in the image whom we need to know are Mary (a.k.a. the Madonna), Jesus (on the right, identified by the fact that he is giving a blessing), and John the Baptist (the child receiving the blessing)</li>

  <li><strong>The staff in JtB’s hand was added later by a conservationist who thought it belonged there</strong></li>
  <li>The one hanging in the National Gallery was likely not done by da Vinci but by his apprentices in his workshop; the one in the Louvre is da Vinci’s.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Attributes of Venus in this painting are that she is naked

<h1 id="topics-from-class">Topics From Class</h1>

<h2 id="conservation-and-restoration">Conservation and Restoration</h2>
<p><strong>Conservation</strong> = preserving the artwork as we receive it or have it today</p>

<p><strong>Restoration</strong> = trying to restore the painting or artwork to its original state</p>

<p><strong>Fresco</strong> was done by painting into wet plaster that was put on top of dry plaster with compositional sketches on it - the paint dried with the second layer of wet plaster and bonded more durably with the plaster. This is why we still have a lot of Renaissance frescoes. After the bulk of the plaster dried, the artist would add details like eyes and faces into the fresco by painting in a “secco” manner.</p>

<p>Secco, by contrast, was done by artists painting right on to the dry plaster. This caused it to flake off relatively easily and quickly. More frescoes survive from the 1200-1600 time period than seccos from the next period. But after 1600, artists began to wonder if it was worth all the work. Clearly, it wasn’t.</p>

<p>More recent paintings use <strong>varnish</strong>, transparent, translucent layer added to paintings to highlight color and protect painting. Modern-day acrylic paintings tend not to use varnish because it’s unnecessary and adds sheen that most artists don’t really want on their paintings.</p>

<p>Original varnishes were made out of amber or egg white, which causes the painting to discolor over time (amber turns orange/sepia, egg white turns yellow/jaundiced). This creates an interesting dilemma for conservationists: <strong>do we remove the discolored varnish and risk damaging the painting to show the “true color,” or leave what we have now?</strong></p>

<p>National Gallery historically has been lambasted for “ruining” paintings by removing varnish. <strong>Case study:</strong> <em>The Battle of San Romano</em> by Paolo Uccello. The cleaning solution the Gallery used removed the top layer of paint and varnish and with it all shading in Uccello’s painting as they were trying to restore it, so the painting just looks dumb now.</p>

<p>There are a few other important conservation gaffes to know:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Santa Croce:</strong> Giotto’s Bodi Chapel: 1700’s, Giotto’s frescoes were whitewashed over and tombs put up. When medieval things became vogue again in the 1800’s, the whitewash and wall tomb was removed, but part of the fresco came with it. In the 1900’s that paint was added back in, but 50 years later, it was removed.
<img src="/assets/images/hoa201/bardi_chapel.jpg" alt="Bardi chapel painting" /></li>
  <li><strong>Leonardo’s Last Supper:</strong> The church with the Last Supper painting was largely destroyed WWII, except the last Supper wall; in the 1980’s, it was decided to conserve Leonardo’s fresco. Leonardo painted 5 frescoes that we know of, and all but this have disappeared, because from the 1500’s onward, the fresco was conserved as it started to fade. As the conservationists stripped down to try and find Leonardo’s base layer, they realized it didn’t exist, that it had also faded over time. So the conservationists repainted the entire thing to hide the story.
<img src="/assets/images/hoa201/leonardo_supper.jpg" alt="Leonardo's Last Supper" /></li>
  <li><strong>Sistine Chapel:</strong> The conservationists removed shadows and shading along the ceiling because “Michelangelo wouldn’t have painted in secco.” When they realized he would, they were about half-way done with the vault (ceiling), so they just finished removing the shadows and shading throughout the entire chapel. The whole thing now looks a little Disney.
Michelangelo sketches reveal that he intended to use shadows.
<img src="/assets/images/hoa201/michelangelo_sistine.jpg" alt="Michelangelo Sistine Chapel" /></li>
  <li><strong>Adam and Eve:</strong> Massolino and Massaccio’s Adam and Eve painting was restored, arts of the bodies were missing. Restorers chose to interpret Adam and Eve as without genital coverings. This Adam and Eve is now the only Adam and Eve without coverings.
<img src="/assets/images/hoa201/masolino_masaccio_adam_eve.jpg" alt="Masolino and Masaccio Adam and Eve" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-art-market">The Art Market</h2>
<p>The art market is all about <em>taste;</em> if a piece is fashionable, it goes up in price. <em>Example:</em> van Gogh’s paintings were worth probably <em>literal</em> dirt when he was alive, but now, if you were to try to pay for a van Gogh painting with dirt, it would be like, an absurd amount of dirt. Nothing’s changed about the paintings, but demand has gone up, and so has the volume of dirt.</p>

<p>The art market is completely non-competitive. That is, there are no substitute goods for a Leonardo, it’s just not how a market based off of unique objects works. Art by dead artists tends to be worth more because there won’t be any more produced, unlike living artists whose finite number of paintings hasn’t yet been established.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution</strong> is achieved by <strong>connoisseurship.</strong> It is the labeling of an artist as the creator of an artwork, hopefully correctly. However, it doesn’t always go quite that smoothly:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Modigliani farce:</strong> a few students and an artist sank fake Modigliani heads into a river where there were plans to search for art. The three heads were found and the art community quickly identified them as genuine Modigliani pieces. Eventually the students and the artist came forward. Twas a massive embarrassment for the connoisseurship community.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="art-education">Art Education</h2>

<p>Historically, there were two traditional places of learning for artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Workshops</strong> were practically the only way of teaching artists up until about the 1600s. Inside of workshops, young boys would be apprenticed to a master painter at an early age - they would get food, lodging, and an trade education while the master would get a minion. The boys would learn to emulate the master’s style and, if they got good enough, could strike out on their own and start their own workshop and do their own work.</p>

<p><strong>Academies</strong> were schools of art. There were many teachers, and students could go to different teachers to learn different things. This allowed for more diverse learning and artistic style as the student has freedom to discover their own specialty and style. The first academy was opened in <strong>1531</strong> in Rome by <strong>Baccio Bandinelli</strong>. In the school, artists engaged in a reciprocal relationship with the medical community where doctoral students would dissect models for the artists to draw anatomically, and the artists would produce anatomical renderings of the models (see <a href="#anatomy-and-art-education">section on anatomy and art education</a>).</p>

<p>In 1563, Visari opened a second academy, the <em>Accademia del Disegno</em> in Florence, publicly funded by the Medici family and other politicians. The <em>Academia</em> had a three-year cirriculum:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Just drawing</li>
  <li>Students choose a specification</li>
  <li>Completion of training
Students also studied mathematical perspective and other “good shit”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other important dates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1591 - <strong>Academy of St. Luke</strong> opened in Rome, and it’s <em>still open today.</em></li>
  <li><strong>1768 - Royal Academy</strong>, first academy opened in London by Sir John Reynolds. Reynolds wanted more diverse art (because only portrait and landscape had been allowed or done since Henry VIII, the bastard) and more democratic training for artists. In the Royal Academy, artists could paint whatever they wanted! To encourage the public to buy allegory and religious paintings, Reynolds held exhibitions of paintings done by third-years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>History Paintings</strong> was a genre of paintings developed by Reynolds. The idea was to depict, with “historical” accuracy, things that had happened in contemporary history, literature, art, etc. Some new, non-iconographic religious art could be created! They weren’t fit for church though (I mean, same, really). We also got some neat pics of Shakespearean plays and stuff.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-and-art-education">Anatomy and Art Education</h2>
<p>Leonardo believed that artists first had to understand anatomy to be able to accurately portray bodies in motion or poses. He and many other artists did some (arguably dodgy) dissections on exhumed bodies until the 1530s, then that had to stop. Some artists went to see public executions, such as at the gallows, to see what bodies looked like without doin’ the illegal.</p>

<p>In 1543, the first anatomy textbook was published. Students of medicine watched as doctors dissected medical subjects. Artists came and drew as it happened. This was a mutually benificial relationship: artists got to have subjects for their paintings without skirting the law, and medicine students and teachers got artistic renderings of their work for new textbooks and teaching materials. <em>Useful to know: an <strong>Ecorche</strong> is a model of a body with no skin. Helps to understand muscles and how they work.</em></p>

<p>By the 17th Century, this practice largely faded away. Medicine no longer needed artists to reproduce their anatomical drawings, and artists didn’t really need to go to see dissections with the advent of better models. Plus, artists were specialising instead of just blanket drawing, so not everyone needed those skills. Artists still, from time to time, prepared models and ecorches for the medical profession and for their own reference.</p>

<h2 id="women-in-art-education">Women in Art Education</h2>

<p>Pretty dismal representation of women, historically and today. By the 1800s, women started to be allowed in art courses in London, but their education was separated from their male colleagues. In 1879, women were allowed to draw from female nude models. It wasn’t until post-WW2 that women and men were doing the same work in the same room, largely without restriction.</p>
